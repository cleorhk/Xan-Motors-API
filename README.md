# Xan-Motors-API
Welcome to the Xan Motors API, a simple REST API built with Python and Flask. This project provides a basic implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing a collection of electric motors. It's a great starting point for learning how to build RESTful APIs and can be extended for more complex applications.
